# The-Balancing-Act
This repository is for a game that will be published to the App Store! I'm also using it to share it with my 10th grade CS&E teacher. Also you turn the phone in order to change the rotation of the platform. I'm dreading making the UI... Although the toughest part will be making sure the camera zooms out if you stack the objects high enough.

Only the meek get pinched. The bold survive.
